                    <h5>About This Project</h5>
                    <p>Meowy Christmas is a simple story about a cat looking for items and ornaments to decorate its
                        tree to
                        celebrate Christmas. This is a group project made by Andrew Ang, Hsuan-Ying Chao, Kejing Ren,
                        Eric
                        Liu and Stella Nguyen, who started on the project as beginners to Maya. After many script ideas,
                        we
                        were inspired to proceed with this story for the festivity as we would be able to deliver it by
                        the
                        time Christmas approaches. </p>
                    <p>
                        I was responsible for brainstorming and scripting for several initial storylines, cat’s concept
                        art,
                        modelling the environment with furniture, cat and penguin characters’ second rigging, texturing
                        the
                        environment, scene animations & renderings, and some initial video editing.

                    <h5>Modelling the Environment</h5>
                    <p> During the process of animations, more issues emerged. I spent a lot of time modeling the
                        environment – the living room and kitchen with basic furniture. I tried to make everything
                        which
                        won't move to stick to the room, but soon I realized it would create more issues Because the
                        room
                        would fill with unnecessary lines and polygons. So I tried to fix the model again and made
                        everything into independent pieces. There are still some issues with the model because
                        fixing a
                        model is much more complicated than building a model. But I tried to make everything smooth
                        and
                        no
                        Ngons as much as possible. </p>
                    <h5>- Texturing the Environment</h5>
                    <p> I textured the room twice. For the first time, I textured them into a modern style, which is
                        basically white and gray. Then my teammates suggested we should use a cartoon color tone
                        that
                        fits
                        our character and story more. So I retextured everything into a warm cartoonish color. There
                        were
                        some other difficulties while using Maya as well, but I overcame them by searching for more
                        tutorials online. </p>

                    <h5>Characters Modelling And Rigging</h5>
                    <p> I also encountered some obstacles for the cat and penguin's rigs. I couldn't open them properly.
                        So
                        I ended up re-rigged both cat and penguin characters again for animations. I also made some
                        adjustments by repainting the skin weights in Maya to generate another rigging version for both
                        of
                        the characters. I use them for all my animations. I also tried fixing scene 19 because the
                        character
                        was not in the room before. It is very painful to fix the scenes. I also asked Eric's help while
                        fixing the scene, but it was unsuccessful because we could not move and scale a fully animated
                        character.

                    <h5>Time Management</h5>
                    <p>And due to technical issues, I animated and rendered half of the scenes in this project
                        individually,
                        and I also helped my teammates with their scenes as they could not render the scenes on their
                        current laptops. I ended up spending a large amount of time finishing this project. Because I
                        knew
                        that rendering would take a long time on my computer, I planned everything accordingly and
                        finished
                        other school works early so we could submit our assignment on time.

                        utilizing the existing tutorials on the human eyes, we adapted the techniques and experimented
                        on
                        the shapes and inner glow/emission effects to achieve a similar look that’s most suitable for

                    <h5>Disney Animation Principles</h5>
                    <p>Furthermore, we would really appreciate it if the audience could notice our animations. We
                        applied
                        several Disney animation principles, such as 'slowing in and slowing out' and 'anticipations.'
                        We
                        tried to make all the movements slow at the beginning and end. For example, the cat sat here
                        slowly
                        and waved hands faster in the middle part, then slowed down again at the end. Anticipations are
                        also
                        involved in our animations, trying to hint at the audience before the actual movement. For
                        example,
                        in the scene where the cat takes a few steps back and tries to look at the top of the tree, the
                        cat
                        tries to lean back several times before he steps back. Like figures 13, 14, and 15 illustrated,
                        the
                        audience will share the anticipation of the cat's stepping back and won't feel weird when the
                        cat
                        does the movement. </p>
