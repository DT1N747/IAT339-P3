                <p>This Pavilion and Pergola model is a group assignment in one of my courses in
                    spring 2022, and Cheryl Liu, Kelly Hu and I all contribute to this project. In this project, we need
                    to design one pavilion for musical recite in Holland Park, Surrey, which can contain at least ten
                    audience members, a piano, and multiple seats. In this project, We came up with this idea during
                    team
                    discussions and finalized all the details and measurements. I did all the modelling works in Rhino
                    and TwinMotion to create a digital model demonstrating our best design, which helped me develop my
                    modelling skills in Rhino, Grasshopper and TwinMotion a lot. I am also responsible of creating the
                    final rendering exhibitions. </p>

                <h5 class="TopMar">Problem and Objective</h5>
                <p>This project aims to design a space for musical events held in Holland Park. Currently, no place in
                    Holland Park can function as an event venue, and that is why we wanted to design a regular venue
                    there, making event planning easier and more affordable in Holland Park. </p>
                <h5 class="TopMar">Key Design Decisions</h5>
                <h6>- Locations, circulation, and Organic Shapes</h6>
                <p>First of all, we went on a field trip to Holland Park in Surrey to see the environment, including
                    lighting, pathway planings, intersection locations, and possible blockage like trees and city
                    facilities that are impossible to move. We chose the pathway intersections that can be accessed from
                    multiple directions and is 15 square feet empty without any blockages or city facilities. After
                    carefully noting the locations and making a scaled fabric top view mock, I analyzed all the possible
                    locations in written documents and their pros and cons. And I planned a centric circulation pattern
                    for this particular place to make sure the audiences could enter and exit freely into this pavilion.
                    Because this pavilion is primarily used for musical recitals in a park, we connected the idea of
                    music with trees. Regardless of its forms, classical music will last very long, documenting lives
                    and histories. Trees are also long-lasting, and they are the testimonies of time. Pavilion with
                    organic shapes also fits perfectly into the part environment. </p>
                <h6 class="TopMargin">- Modelling and Texturing in Rhino and TwinMotion.</h6>
                <p>After finalizing the ideation based on massive discussions, I built this model in
                    Rhino, representing our ideas in a detailed digital form. And then export the model files into
                    TwinMotion to add textures for this digital model and create essential environment elements in
                    Holland Park, including trees that exist in reality. After planning the camera movement in
                    TwinMotion, a final video version of this model was generated. There were a lot of techinical
                    difficulties during the process of making this model, and I spent massive time finding tutorials and
                    testing in Rhino to make a closed polysurface with minimal surfaces because surfaces and curves do
                    not work well in Grasshopper to generate a clean X axis and Y axis structure diagram. This pavilion
                    and pergola combination will be an asset in Holland Park, as this could be a regular event venue.

                <h5 class="TopMar">Technical Skills</h5>
                <p>Technical-wise, I learned many modelling skills in Rhino and TwinMotion. For example,
                    build closed polysurfaces with clean lines and polygons, loft basic geometric meshes into meshes
                    with smooth curvatures, generate shapes and diagrams with Grasshopper in Rhino, and add textures
                    like wood or glass with different reflective values and environment elements like trees and roads in
                    TwinMotion. I also learned to make a video with excellent camera movement and anchored camera
                    positions in TwinMotion. </p>

                <h5 class="TopMar">Design Skills</h5>
                <p> Design-wise, I learned the research process, including going to Holland
                    Park on a field trip to access the location and lightening and relating our design theme with the
                    environment and topic. </p>
                <h5 class="TopMar">Soft Skills</h5>
                <p>Collaboration-wise, I improved my communication skills with my team members
                    and understandably expressed my ideas, for example, illustrating my ideas with straightforward
                    sketches. Moreover, I learned that an efficient, respectful and friendly working atmosphere is super
                    helpful when working in a team.</p>
