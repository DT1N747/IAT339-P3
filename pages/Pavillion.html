                    <p>This Pavilion and Pergola model is a group assignment in one of my courses in
                        spring 2022, and Cheryl Liu, Kelly Hu and I all contribute to this project. In this project, we
                        need
                        to design one pavilion for musical recite in Holland Park, Surrey, which can contain at least
                        ten
                        audience members, a piano, and multiple seats. In this project, We came up with this idea during
                        team
                        discussions and finalized all the details and measurements. I did all the modelling works in
                        Rhino
                        and TwinMotion to create a digital model demonstrating our best design, which helped me develop
                        my
                        modelling skills in Rhino, Grasshopper and TwinMotion a lot. I am also responsible of creating
                        the
                        final rendering exhibitions. </p>

                    <h5 class="TopMar">Problem and Objective</h5>
                    <p>This project aims to design a space for musical events held in Holland Park. Currently, no place
                        in
                        Holland Park can function as an event venue, and that is why we wanted to design a regular venue
                        there, making event planning easier and more affordable in Holland Park. </p>
                    <h5 class="TopMar">Key Design Decisions</h5>
                    <h6>- Locations, circulation, and Organic Shapes</h6>
                    <p>First of all, we went on a field trip to Holland Park in Surrey to see the environment, including
                        lighting, pathway planings, intersection locations, and possible blockage like trees and city
                        facilities that are impossible to move. We chose the pathway intersections that can be accessed
                        from
                        multiple directions and is 15 square feet empty without any blockages or city facilities. After
                        carefully noting the locations and making a scaled fabric top view mock, I analyzed all the
                        possible
                        locations in written documents and their pros and cons. And I planned a centric circulation
                        pattern
                        for this particular place to make sure the audiences could enter and exit freely into this
                        pavilion.
                        Because this pavilion is primarily used for musical recitals in a park, we connected the idea of
                        music with trees. Regardless of its forms, classical music will last very long, documenting
                        lives
                        and histories. Trees are also long-lasting, and they are the testimonies of time. Pavilion with
                        organic shapes also fits perfectly into the part environment. </p>
                    <h6 class="TopMargin">- Modelling and Texturing in Rhino and TwinMotion.</h6>
                    <p>After finalizing the ideation based on massive discussions, I built this model in
                        Rhino, representing our ideas in a detailed digital form. And then export the model files into
                        TwinMotion to add textures for this digital model and create essential environment elements in
                        Holland Park, including trees that exist in reality. After planning the camera movement in
                        TwinMotion, a final video version of this model was generated. There were a lot of techinical
                        difficulties during the process of making this model, and I spent massive time finding tutorials
                        and
                        testing in Rhino to make a closed polysurface with minimal surfaces because surfaces and curves
                        do
                        not work well in Grasshopper to generate a clean X axis and Y axis structure diagram. This
                        pavilion
                        and pergola combination will be an asset in Holland Park, as this could be a regular event
                        venue.

                    <h5 class="TopMar">Technical Skills</h5>
                    <p>Technical-wise, I learned many modelling skills in Rhino and TwinMotion. For example,
                        build closed polysurfaces with clean lines and polygons, loft basic geometric meshes into meshes
                        with smooth curvatures, generate shapes and diagrams with Grasshopper in Rhino, and add textures
                        like wood or glass with different reflective values and environment elements like trees and
                        roads in
                        TwinMotion. I also learned to make a video with excellent camera movement and anchored camera
                        positions in TwinMotion. </p>

                    <h5 class="TopMar">Design Skills</h5>
                    <p> Design-wise, I learned the research process, including going to Holland
                        Park on a field trip to access the location and lightening and relating our design theme with
                        the
                        environment and topic. </p>
                    <h5 class="TopMar">Soft Skills</h5>
                    <p>Collaboration-wise, I improved my communication skills with my team members
                        and understandably expressed my ideas, for example, illustrating my ideas with straightforward
                        sketches. Moreover, I learned that an efficient, respectful and friendly working atmosphere is
                        super
                        helpful when working in a team.</p>
