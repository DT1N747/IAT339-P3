        <h3>Positive and Enthusiastic.</h3>
        <p>As an aspiring Interactive Art and Technology major at Simon Fraser University, I possess a passion for UI/UX
            design and a dedication to creating captivating user experiences. My primary focus lies in creating
            captivating user experiences through visually appealing interfaces. I am also proficient in a range of 3D
            modeling software, including Maya, Rhino, and Vray, I am skilled at producing high-quality 3D models with
            meticulous attention to detail. My skills in UI/UX design have allowed me to develop a deep understanding of
            user-centered design principles and the ability to create visually appealing and intuitive interfaces.
            Through my studies and hands-on projects, I have honed my ability to craft user journeys, conduct usability
            testing, and iterate designs based on user feedback. This experience has given me a strong foundation in
            designing interfaces that seamlessly blend aesthetics with functionality. One of my key strengths is my
            ability to effectively communicate and collaborate with others. Recognizing the importance of teamwork, I
            actively contribute to group projects, fostering a friendly and efficient work atmosphere. By actively
            listening to others' perspectives, I embrace diverse ideas and incorporate them into my design process to
            produce innovative and inclusive solutions. With my combination of technical skills, design expertise, and
            collaborative mindset, I am excited to contribute to the field of UI/UX design and create meaningful
            experiences for users.</p>
